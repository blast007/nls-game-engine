// *TODO: From what I see browsing around, the expected structure is:
/*
 {common} A navbar with logo on left and search on right, all inline.
 {mainpage} A large full-width block that I'll call the Catcher, as it's designed to catch the attention and "advertise" the tool.
 {mainpage} A block of subblocks, each subblock containing things like the latest news/events/careers, explanitory information, featured projects, etc.
 {common} A footer containing copyright info and maybe some unimportant-to-most-people links (such as privacy policy, FAQ, support, contact, etc).
*/

	The NLS Engine is free to use in any project, any scale, at any time.  We just ask that you respect our effort by following the simple terms laid out in the license given below.
	
	The engine is released in two forms: "stable" binary releases on which you can create games, and source code.
	The source code version also comes in two flavors: the "stable" braches the binary releases are created from, and the current in-active-development repository tip.  By the term "stable" we simply mean that the interfaces and structure will remain the same in that release.  Likewise "unstable" means that the APIs, and possibly even the ability to compile, is uncertain.  None are guranteed to not blow up your computer, burn your house down, or cause your cat to go crazy - not that it's likely to do such a thing! :P  We do our best to make sure it works, but software is software - check out our source code and let us know if you find anything that could be a source of problems!
	
	\section releases Releases
	Download from the \htmlonly <a href="https://bitbucket.org/adam4813/nls-engine/downloads">list of downloads</a>\endhtmlonly.
	
	
	Simply extract the contents of the archive, modify the contents of the configuration script, and start creating your game!
	
	\section source Source code
	
	The source code can also be downloaded from the \htmlonly<a href="https://bitbucket.org/adam4813/nls-engine/downloads">list of downloads</a>\endhtmlonly as a compressed archive, however it is recommeded that you instead use a Mercurial client to clone the \htmlonly<a href="https://bitbucket.org/adam4813/nls-engine">public repository</a>\endhtmlonly.
	
	We welcome contributions in any form; whether you donate scripts, source patches, improved documentation, or even whole modules, we would love to see them.  There is a caveat however: every contributor must sign and send us a copy of the \htmlonly<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N9EUxB3OvoSWh9TLbEiKzfhP0MZrAikBqFqXPcDHfNc/edit">contributor's agreement</a>\endhtmlonly - with one exception.  This agreement simply assignes to us copyright on the items you send us so that we can keep our code free and clear to all.  The one exception mentioned earlier is if the contribution is clearly marked as being released under the zlib license itself we'll accept it without a contribution assignment on file.  Of course it should go without stating that everything contributed must be your own work - otherwise you can't legally change the terms you got it under!
